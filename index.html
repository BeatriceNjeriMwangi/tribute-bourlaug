    <li><span>1953</span> -Crosses a short ,study dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yieldling American breed,creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer.It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</li>

    <li><span>2005</span> -states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demands, as we run out arable land .Says that GM crop are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plantsb and animals for a long time . Long before we called science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
    <li><span>2009</span> -dies at the age of 95.</li>
</ul>

    "Bourlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
